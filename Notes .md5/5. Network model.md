### What is a networking model ?
Networking model categorize and provides a structure for networking protocols and structure.

**What is protocols?**
A set of rules (logical rules not physical) defining how network device and software should work.

**Network without standardization :**
If del make of networking model and i mac own so they can't communicate to each other.

- OSI model : used for research purpose
- TCP/IP mode : develop to meet the need of internet design.
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">HTTP, FTP, TCP, IP these are the protocol used on respective layers.</mark> 

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Routing : </mark> is process of sending a ip packet from one network to another network it not down in local network. Routing is done because ARP can't provide mac address of another device because its not in same network.
if device is in same network ARP Request is sent.
[[7. IPv4, Ipv6#routing]]
## OSI model 
OSI stand for **Open system interconnection** model.
OSI model created by **international organization for standardization** (ISO) IN later 17es.

---
>**Encapsulation :** The data is processed through the OSI stack from top to bottom , each layer adding something to original data this is called Encapsulation.

>**De-Encapsulation :** As the additional information is removed as the data is processed bottom to up the stack is called De-Encapsulation.

### Summary of OSI Model
- **Layer 1**: Physical – Transmits raw bits
- **Layer 2**: Data Link – Frames and error detection
- **Layer 3**: Network – Routing and addressing
- **Layer 4**: Transport – End-to-end communication
- **Layer 5**: Session – Managing sessions
- **Layer 6**: Presentation – Data translation and encryption
- **Layer 7**: Application – User interface and application services

Let's discuss all one by one.

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">7. Application</mark>
- This is closes to **end user.** 
- Interacts with software applications
- HTTP , HTTPS , FTP, IRC, SSH, DNS **are Layer 7 Protocols.**

>The communication between the application layer of the two different system is called **Same layer interaction.**

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">6. Presentation</mark>
- In short, The presentation layer translates data to appropriate format.
- Data in the application layer is in `application format`.It need to be `translated` to a different format to be send over the network.
- The presentation layer job is to translate between application and network formats.
- EX: encryption of data as it is send, and decryption of data as it is received.

5. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Session </mark>
- control dialogues (sessions) between communicating hosts.
- Establish, manage and terminate connection between local application and the remote application.

---
**• Network engineers don't usually work with the top 3 layers.**
• Application developers work with the top layers of the OSI model to connect their applications over networks.

---

4. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Transport</mark>
- Segments and reassembles data for communications between end hosts. 
- Breaks large pieces of data into smaller segments which can be more easily sent over the network and are less likely to cause transmission problems if errors occur.
>**Provide host-to-host communication.**

>Functions:  it manage Flow control , error control , **sizing the packets.**


3. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Network</mark>
- Provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks (ie. outside of the LAN).
- Provides logical addressing (IP addresses).
- Provides path selection between source and destination.
- Routers operate at Layer 3.

>Function : Logical addressing , routing , path determination.

2. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Data Link</mark>
- Provides node -to -node connectivity and data transfer (for example, PC to switch, switch to router, router to router).
- Defines how data is formatted for transmission over a physical medium (for example, copper UTP cables)
- Detects and (possibly) corrects Physical Layer errors.
- Uses Layer 2 addressing, separate from Layer 3 addressing.



1. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">physical</mark>
- Defines physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data between devices. For example, voltage (eve(S) maximum transmission distances, physical connectors, cable specifications, etc.
- Digital bits are converted into electrical (for wired connections) or radio (for wireless connections) signals.

### PDUs
0. Data or payload or packet (all is same) = is created by top 3 layer.
1. **L4 header = Layer 4 header**  is called Segment. Segment is a term for L4 PDU.
2. **L3 header = Layer 3 header**  is called packet. Packet is a term for L3 PDU.
3. After adding L2 as well whole it is called <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">FRAME</mark>.
this Frame is sent through cables to other system and then De-Encapsulated.

## TCP/IP MODEL
- **TCP/IP Model**: A framework for the communication protocols used in the Internet and various networks.
- Known as TCP/IP because those are two of the foundation protocols in the suite.
- **Development**: Created by the U.S. Department of Defense through DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">OSI is created by ISO.</mark>
- **Layer Structure**: Similar to the OSI model but with fewer layers.
- **Current Use**: The primary model in <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">modern networking.</mark>
- **Influence**: The OSI model still shapes discussions and practices among network engineers.

## OSI vs TCP/IP
OSI and TCP/IP both are logical models. One of the main similarities between the OSI and TCP/IP models is that they both describe how information is transmitted between two devices across a network. Both models define a set of layers. Each layer performs a specific set of functions to enable the transmission of data.

**Real-World Application**:
- The TCP/IP model is widely used in practical networking and forms the basis for the Internet.
- The OSI model serves as a theoretical guide but is less commonly implemented in its entirety.


**Protocol Specification**:
- **OSI Model**: Does not prescribe specific protocols; it provides a framework for different protocols to operate within each layer.
- **TCP/IP Model**: Includes specific protocols defined for each layer, such as:
    - **Application Layer**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP
    - **Transport Layer**: TCP, UDP
    - **Internet Layer**: IP (IPv4, IPv6)
