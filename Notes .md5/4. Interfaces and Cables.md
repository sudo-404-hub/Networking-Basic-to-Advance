### RJ-45 (Registered jack)
This is present at end node of ethernet cable.

### Ethernet 
it is the collection of network protocols / standards.

- why protocols needed?
Because if everyone  make own protocols they many device can't internet with each other properly. if one people know English and one know Hindi they can't communicate so a standard language need as well a standard protocols needed on which all device communicate.

### Bit and Byte
Bite : 0 or 1 
byte : 8 bite is 1 byte

device send one bite(0 or 1) at a time not byte at a time (1001011011).
so speed is measure in bites per second , not bytes per second.
1 kb = 1,000 bites
1Mb = 1,000,000 bites
1GB =  1,000,000,000 bites
1Tb  =  1,000,000,000,000 bites


**Ethernet standards**
Standard Ethernet also known as **IEEE 802.3** was the LAN standard proposed by IEEE (the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) . Data rate for standard Ethernet is 10 Mbps.

10BASE-T, 10GBASE-T
BASE = refer to baseband signaling.
T = Twisting pair 

## **UTP cables** (unshielded Twisted pair)
due to **Unshielded** they can be vulnerable to electrical interference.
Twisting helps against electromagnetic interference (EMI).
**Advantages**:- cheap, easy to work with **Disadvantages**:- low data rate, short range
>4 Twisted pair of cable mean 8 wire, each pair have 2 wire. 

>UTP cable only used up to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">100meter</mark>

RJ45 connector have 8 pin to connect these 8 wire.
but not all cable have 8 wire:
- 10BASE-T  or 100BASE-T = 2 pairs (4 wires) (fast)
- 1000BASE-T or 10GBASE-T = 4 pairs (8 wires) (super fast)

Lets take a look at 10BASE-T/ 100BASE-T cables:

1. To connect PC to a switch we use **Full Duplex cable.**
wire 1,2 send data from pc and 1,2 receive data in switch.
wire 3,4 receive data in pc and 3,4 send data in switch.

2. **To connect ROUTER To SWITCH Straight through cable use:**


![[straight through cable 1.png]]

3. **To connect <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">router to router</mark> or <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">switch to switch</mark>  we can't use straight through cable**
   **we have to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">use crossover cable</mark> 
![[straight through cable 2.png]]
![[straight through cable 3.png]]

**we have to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">use crossover cable</mark>  to connect switch to switch or router to router.
![[crossover cable 1.png]]

- we can also use **crossover cable to connect router to pc.**

![[crossover cable 2.png]]

![[table tx pin and rx pins.png]]


**10G-BASE-T**
this also use 4,5 and 7,8 wire as well for faster interconnection.
They are bidirectional. 
"bidirectional" refers to the ability to transmit and receive data simultaneously in both directions over the same medium.

## Auto MDI-X
Auto MDI-X (Automatic Medium Dependent Interface Crossover) is a technology used in Ethernet networking that automatically detects and configures the connection type for network devices. This feature allows devices to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">connect using either straight-through or crossover Ethernet cables </mark>without requiring manual configuration.

**HOW auto MDI-X do it:** 
he device analyzes the incoming signals to determine whether it is connected to another switch, router, or end device. Based on the detection, the device reconfigures its transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) pairs accordingly.

## Fiber optic connections

- **STP Transceiver (Small form factor pluggable)**
STP is used to connect fiber optic fire to switch.

![[sft .png]]
![[fiber optic.png]]

- This is a fiber optic cable connects to STP transceiver.

![[fiber optic cable.png]]

-  This is how fiber optic wire send and receive data.
  as we see before it have 2 wire one for sending data and another for receiving data.
![[fiber optic tx rx.png]]

- Inside the Fiber Optic cable their are 4 parts.
1. the fiberglass core itself
2. cladding that reflects light
3. a protective buffer
4. the outer jacket of the cable
![[inside fiber optic.png]]

- 2 type of fiber optic
1. multi mode
2. single mode

center white represent the **fiberglass**. blue represent the **reflect glass.**
- In single mode reflective glass width is less.
- In multi mode  reflective glass width is more. as you can see in diagram.
