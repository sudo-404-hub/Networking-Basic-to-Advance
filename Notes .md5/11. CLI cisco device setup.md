CLI stand for **Command line Interface.**

## How to connect to cisco device?
Their is multiple ways.
1. BY Cable
2. Remotely

SO to connect by cable you have 2 port.
1. RJ45
2. USB Mini-B
![[CLI connect ports.png]]
- This <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Rollover wire</mark> is need to connect RJ45 to pc.
- one end in this pic have RJ45 port one and 2nd one is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">DD9 connector</mark>.
- now days no laptop have serial connector to connect DD9 connector so we need a adapter show in pic at right side.

## Putty
After connect pc to cisco device we need an software PUTTY by we can access CTI.

Click on serial and configure the speed, data bites, stop bites and more as same as shown below.  and press OK.
- These are the default setting to connect to CISCO device.

## Configure Cisco device

### Basic mode

`Router >` = user EXEC mode
`Router#` = privileged EXEC mode
`Router (config) #` = global configuration mode

Their are 5 mode in device like we have 2 in Linux simple user and root user.

1. **User EXEC Mode** also called **user mode**
   - It show like `Router>` 
     Router is Host name of device
     `>` it indicate you are in user exec mode

2. **Privilege EXEC Mode**
  - Access to advanced commands.
   - Allows entry into configuration modes.
   - Entered by typing `enable`.
   - It show like `Router#`
     Router is the Host name of device
     `#` it indicate you are root user.

3. **Global Configuration Mode**:
- Device-wide configuration changes.
   It show like `router (config) # `
   config mean you are in Global Configuration Mode.

> To go in Global Configuration Mode First you have to go in **Privilege EXEC Mode** by command `enable` then use `configure terminal` command to go in **Global Configuration Mode**

`configure terminal` = `conf t`
4. **Interface Configuration Mode**:
   - Configuration for specific interfaces (e.g., Ethernet).
   - Accessed by typing `interface <interface_id>` in global configuration.

5. **Line Configuration Mode**:
   - Manage terminal lines (e.g., console, VTY).
   - Accessed by typing `line <line_type> <line_number>` in global configuration.

   
---
- `Router` is just the default host name of device. To change it use command:
  `hostname YourNewHostname`
> must be in global configure mode 
- To see all commands use `?` 

#### command shortcut
  their is shortcut command of each and every command to use it just type the starting character of the command.
  ex: `enable` = `en` and enter. or press `tab` to see command.
  but is you only `e` it show and error like this `% Ambiguous command : "e" `
  it mean their is more command start with `e`. 
  - To see them all type `e?`
  `conf t` = `configure terminal`


---

### Configure Password

To change password you should have **Global Configuration Mode**.

>`enable password?` show a word password telling about shortcut.
>`enable password ?` it tell all the option in the command.


>`enable passowrd your_pass` it change the password.

>`enable passowrd your_pass ?` this `?` search is their any further option or not if no it print `<cr>`

### configuration files 
>**Enter Privileged EXEC Mode** to see these files.


Lets discuss about 2 imp files.
1. **Running-config**: The current, active configure file on the device. As you enter commands in CLI , you edit the active configuration.
   - `show running-config` To see this running-config file.
2. **startup-config**= the configuration file that will be loaded up on restart of device.
   - `show startup-config` To see startup-config file.


#### 3 ways to save running configure file in startup-config file:

> **Privileged EXEC mode**  is required to run this commands:
```bash
# all 3 command works same.
write
write memory
copy running-config startup-config
```

### password-encryption
As password is stored in startup-config file as a plain text that can be security risk so we can use encryption to make it secure.

>Global configuration mode is required to set up it.

>`service password-encryption` It encrypted the password by CISCO preparatory encryption algorithm, how ever its <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">not also secure</mark>


If you enable service password-encryption...
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">• current passwords will be encrypted.</mark>
• future passwords will be encrypted.
• the enable secret will not be effected.

because it can be easy crack by a online tools as well. 
`enable password CISCO` this is the password store in startup-config file after use this command it get encrypted and shown like this.
`enable passsword 7 08026f6028` this 7 indicate  CISCO preparatory encryption algorithm  and further is password hash.

To make it <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">more secure</mark> use command:
>`enable secret your_pass`

This use the MD5 algorithm that's more secure. show like 
`enable secret 5 $1$mERr$Y1CkLjkhsakdjh11` 5 indicate the MD5 algorithm used.

>if both used the both store but only `enable secret` command is valid.

### canceling command
```bash
no service password-encryption
```

If you disable service password-encryption...
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">• current passwords will not be decrypted.</mark>
• future passwords will not be encrypted.


## IPv4 addressing for cisco router

1. **Access the Router:**
   - Connect to your router using a console cable or SSH.

2. **Enter Privileged EXEC Mode:**
   ```bash
   enable
   ```

3. **Enter Global Configuration Mode:**
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   ```


- **Before Configuration:**
  ```bash
  Router# show ip interface brief
  Interface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol
  GigabitEthernet0/0     unassigned      YES unset  administratively down  down
  ```
- if you are in Global Configuration Mode: `show ip interface brief` not work it work in privilege EXCE mode , so to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">run from Global mode </mark>use : `do show ip interface brief`

4. **Select the Interface:**
   For example, if you want to configure `GigabitEthernet0/0`, enter:
   ```bash
   interface GigabitEthernet0/0
   ```

5. **Assign the IP Address:**
   For example, to set the IP address to `192.168.1.1` with a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0`, enter:
   ```bash
   ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
   ```

6. **Enable the Interface:**
   By default, many interfaces are administratively down. To enable the interface, enter:
   ```bash
   no shutdown
   ```

7. **Exit Configuration Mode:**
   To exit back to global configuration mode:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

8. **Save Your Configuration:**
   To ensure the changes are not lost after a reboot, save the configuration:
   ```bash
   write memory
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   copy running-config startup-config
   ```

- **After Configuration:**
  ```bash
  Router# show ip interface brief
  Interface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol
  GigabitEthernet0/0     192.168.1.1     YES manual up                    up
  ```
- **Interface:** The name of the interface (e.g., `GigabitEthernet0/0`).
- **IP-Address:** The assigned IP address of the interface (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
- **OK?:** Indicates whether the IP address configuration is valid (YES or NO).
- **Method:** The method used to assign the IP address (e.g., manual, DHCP, or unset).
- **Status:** The administrative status of the interface (up or down).
- **Protocol:** The operational status of the interface (up or down).

### more detail about specific interface
The command `show interface g0/0` (or `show interface GigabitEthernet0/0`) provides detailed information about the specified interface on a Cisco device. Here's what you can expect from the output of this command:

- `show interface description` it give one more column description can be useful. 
- `show interface g0/0` give info of specific interface.
