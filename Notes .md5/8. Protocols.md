Protocols are likened to rulebooks that define how data is transmitted, and receives accross network. They are essential for maintaining order and standardization in network communication.

**TCP and UDP**:- Data delivery methods

**TCP (Transmission control protocol)**:- Ensure reliable data delivery by confirming data arrival and order, like sending a registered letter.

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**:- Focuses on speed, sending data without confirmation, akin to droped a post card in the email.

## **Most common protocols**

| OSI Layer                 | Protocols                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Layer 7: Application**  | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS  |
| **Layer 6: Presentation** | SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG, GIF     |
| **Layer 5: Session**      | NetBIOS, RPC, PPTP           |
| **Layer 4: Transport**    | TCP, UDP, SCTP               |
| **Layer 3: Network**      | IP, ICMP, IGMP, ARP          |
| **Layer 2: Data Link**    | Ethernet, PPP, Frame Relay   |
| **Layer 1: Physical**     | Ethernet (cabling), DSL, USB |

| TCP/IP Layer                   | Protocols                     |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Layer 4: Application**       | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS   |
| **Layer 3: Transport**         | TCP, UDP, SCTP                |
| **Layer 2: Internet**          | IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, ARP    |
| **Layer 1: Network Interface** | Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11), PPP |
**Introduction to protocol**:- Protocols are like the secret rules for procedures for data transmission between electronic devices, ensuring smooth communication the traffic flaws of internet highways.

**HTTP and HTTPS**:- Web browsing essentials

**HTTP(Hyper text transfer protocol**:- Foundation for web data exchange, governing how files (text, images, videos are transmitted online.)

**HTTPS( https secure)**:- A secure version of HTTP, encrypting communication between browsers and websites, crucial for secure data transmission like credit card into.

**FTP**:- Efficient file transfer

**FTP (File Transfer Protocol**:- A workhorse protocol for moving large files or group of files between.

**SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol)**:- Sends emails from send to recipent's email server.

**IMAP (Internet Message access protocol)**:- Retreives email from the email server, allowing access from multiple devices.

**POP(Post office protocol)**:- Retrieves email from the email server but typically download them to a single device, removing them from the server.
## TCP protocol (transmission control protocal)
#### TCP Connection Establishment (Three-Way Handshake)

1. **SYN**: The client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server to initiate a connection.
2. **SYN-ACK**: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet to acknowledge the receipt of the SYN.
3. **ACK**: The client sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server, completing the handshake and establishing the connection.

Error detection is done by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ARQ</mark>
>ARQ (Automatic repeat request) : When a packet is lost  receiver don't send a ACK to sender and sender get to know something want wrong and send the packet again.
#### Termination of Connection

TCP connections are terminated gracefully using a four-way handshake:

1. **FIN**: One side (e.g., client) sends a FIN (finish) packet to terminate the connection.
2. **ACK**: The other side acknowledges the FIN with an ACK.
3. **FIN**: The second side then sends its own FIN to terminate the connection.
4. **ACK**: The first side acknowledges this FIN, and the connection is fully closed.


#### TCP Header Structure

The TCP header is typically between <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">20 byte to 60 bytes</mark>

| Field                 | Size (Bits) | Description                                           |

| Options (if any)      | Variable    | Additional options (e.g., Maximum Segment Size)       |
| Padding               | Variable    | Padding to ensure the header is a multiple of 32 bits |

The IP header (for IPv4) is typically 20 bytes but can also be longer with options. The structure is as follows:

## UTP
UDP is suitable for applications such as:
UDP is ideal for real-time and low-latency applications where some packet loss is acceptable, such as
✓ video streaming
✓ online gaming
✓ VoIP (Voice over IP)
✓ DNS queries
✓ IoT device communication.


## DHCP SERVER
>**DHCP Server** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) : Routers can assign IP addresses to devices on the network automatically, which simplifies network management.
